# NIND, as "nouvelle indexation"

New Indexation method in the Amose SearchEngine since the former ``S2`` is deprecated.

In 2014, Atejcon developed and documented nind, a simple indexing module based on flat files. An adaptation to Amose, the CEA-LVIC search engine was built from nind.
nind uses a flat file system for indexing and searching. These files are accessible outside real-time to make different analyzes of the indexed corpus.
